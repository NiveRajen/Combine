//Your app may subscribe to a feed of data that could give you repeated values. Imagine a weather app for example that periodically checks the temperature. If your
//app keeps getting the same temperature then there may be no need to send it through the pipeline and update the UI.
//The removeDuplicates could be a solution so your app only responds to data that has changed rather than getting duplicate data. If the data being sent through
//the pipeline conforms to the Equatable protocol then this operator will do all the work of removing duplicates for you.

//The removeDuplicates(by:) operator works like the removeDuplicates operator but for objects that do not conform to the Equatable protocol. (Objects that conform to the Equatable protocol can be compared in code to see if they are equal or not.)
//Since removeDuplicates wonâ€™t be able to tell if the previous item is the same as the current item, you can specify what makes the two items equal inside this closure.

//You will find the tryRemoveDuplicates is just like the removeDuplicates(by:) operator except it also allows you to throw an error within the closure. In the
//closure where you set your condition on what is a duplicate or not, you can throw an error if needed and the subscriber (or other operators) will then handle the error.
